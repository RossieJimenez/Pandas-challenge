    "# School District Data Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on school and student data within a district. Using the pandas library in Python, various calculations and summary statistics were performed to gain insights into the district's educational performance. The key metrics include the total number of schools and students, budget information, average scores in math and reading, and the overall passing rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings and Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Performance Metrics: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The district comprises a total of 15 schools and 39,170 students. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The average math score across all schools is 78.99, while the average reading score is 81.88. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The district has an overall passing rate of 65.17% based on students who passed both math and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. School Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Top Performing Schools:\n",
    "    * These schools exhibit exceptional performance in both math and reading, reflecting a strong educational environment.\n",
    "    * The top five schools with the highest overall passing rates are:\n",
    "        * Cabrera High School: Charter\n",
    "        * Thomas High School: Charter\n",
    "        * Griffin High School: Charter\n",
    "        * Wilson High School: Charter\t\n",
    "        * Pena High School: Charter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bottom Performing Schools:\n",
    "    * These schools may require further attention and intervention to improve student outcomes. \n",
    "    * Conversely, the bottom five schools with the lowest overall passing rates are:\n",
    "        * Rodriguez High School: District\n",
    "        * Figueroa High School: District\t\n",
    "        * Huang High School: District\t\n",
    "        * Hernandez High School: District\t\n",
    "        * Johnson High School: District\t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Type of School and Performance Relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A preliminary analysis suggests a potential correlation between the type of school allocated to schools and their overall performance. The Charter School type seems to be expected to have better resources and, consequently, higher passing rates. It is important to note that the Schools as District types have lower passing rates which indicates that type has a major impact on rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Grade-Level Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The analysis of math and reading scores by grade level indicates variations in performance across different grades. This insight could guide targeted adjustments to address specific challenges faced by students in certain grade levels. In this case, even though Charter schools perform better, it doesnt seem that they improve formidably throughout the years. \n",
